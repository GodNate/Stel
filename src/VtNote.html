                5 months ago, I promised myself that I wouldn't pursue a relationship with anyone from my school, worried that it would be embarrassing if I did something silly. However, when I met you, I was immediately drawn to you and wanted to get to know you better. I was hesitant to make a move, however, scared that things might become awkward between us if I flirted or confessed my feelings and you didn't reciprocate. Despite my worries, I still find myself admiring you from afar over these past few months.

                Though this website may not be perfect, I'm still learning, so please bear with me. I created this website for you as a Valentine's gift, because I wanted to give you something special instead of just buying a something. I figured that making this website would be a much more meaningful gesture.
            </p>

                I tell you this everyday, but you are the most beautiful person I know, inside and out and I see that more clearly with each passing day. I love everything about you, about us. You do something to me that no other has, you have made me so happy, the happiest I’ve ever been. You give me the most amazing feelings inside and its been exciting and just pure bliss. I’ve never met someone that was so good for me, and made me want them to this extent. Now that we’re together my smile never fades anymore, you’ve got me enthused about life and the little things it has to offer.

                        I see the crystal raindrops fall<br>
                        And the beauty of it all<br>
                        Is when the sun comes shining through<br>
                        To make those rainbows in my mind<br>
                        When I think of you sometime<br>
                        And I wanna spend some time with you<br><br>
                        Just the two of us<br>
                        We can make it if we try<br>
                        Just the two of us<br>

                        We look for love, no time for tears<br>
                        Wasted water's all that is<br>
                        And it don't make no flowers grow<br>
                        Good things might come to those who wait<br>
                        Not for those who wait too late<br>
                        We gotta go for all we know<br><br>
                        Just the two of us<br>

                        On the window down the hall<br>
                        And it becomes the morning dew<br>
                        And darling when the morning comes<br>
                        And I see the morning sun<br>
