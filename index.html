      <h1>Happy Valentines Mi Amor</h1>

      <p>I can only use so many words in the dictionary to show you how much I love you. You are always on my mind, putting a smile on my face and making my heart skip a beat. I promise you that my actions, affection, adoration and commitment will always be true and real. You have captured my soul and every bit of me, making me feel like the only man in the world. Life without you is like living without a backbone. You have held me afloat and will keep on lighting our path. I promise to never leave you. </p>
      <p>
        Everything you do, the way you eat, the way you smile, the way my name rolls off of your tongue - that all is what keeps me going. It brings me so much joy to watch you be you. I would never give my attention to anyone else because I love giving it to you. You are an Angel from Heaven, and loving you has been the most significant victory in my short life. 
      </p>

      <p>I hope that I am able to express my love for you in the best way possible, for it is infinite and never-ending. I will keep showing you how much I love you for the rest of my life.
